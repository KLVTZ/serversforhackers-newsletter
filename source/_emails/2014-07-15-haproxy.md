            <h3>High Availability Proxy</h3>
            <p>HAProxy is built for handling large amounts of concurrent connections while using a stable amount of memory. There are many options for Load Balancers out there, but HAProxy does its job very well for free, while also packing in some really nice features! In this edition we'll see how to install, setup and run HAProxy.</p>
            <p>This load balancer will let you distribute traffic amongst multiple servers in your infrastructure - not just HTTP requests but also lower-level TCP based requests. This enables you to distribute all sorts of traffic, such as reading from a database cluster.</p>
            <p>If your server is (or will be) struggling to keep up with your traffic, you'll want to know about HAProxy! In this edition, we'll see how to install, configure and use HAProxy for managing traffic between web servers.</p>
