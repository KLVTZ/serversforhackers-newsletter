            <h3>Getting Off of MAMP</h3>
            <p>Many questions seen in IRC, Stack Overflow, Twitter and other areas show that there are many developers who are ready to transcend their MAMP, WAMP and XAMPP environments. This article will cover making the transition from these environments to a "real" web server, using <strong>Vagrant</strong>.</p>
            <p>This will cover configuring Vagrant to install Ubuntu 12.04, and getting yourself setup with a LAMP stack.</p>

            <h3>Configuring Apache Virtual Hosts</h3>
            <p>After installing a LAMP stack, it's important to know how to configure Apache to suit your needs. SFH has your back here. You'll learn how to use Apache Virtual Hosts so you can setup virtual hosts per project, rather than dump each project into the same, shared directory. This is useful for developing in frameworks which prefer the public web root to be separate from the application code files.</p>
