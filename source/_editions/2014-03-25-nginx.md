## Nginx as Frontman

> Apache is like Microsoft Word, it has a million options but you only need six. Nginx does those six things, and it does five of them 50 times faster than Apache. - [Chris Lea](http://wiki.nginx.org/WhyUseIt)

Nginx is a lightweight alternative to Apache. It does less things, but still covers 90% of the most common use cases.

When we run PHP with Apache, a typical setup is to use the PHP5 Module. This means PHP is essentially loaded and available on every request, even for static files and images! That creates some overhead for each web request.

Nginx, on the other hand, deals primarily with static files, prefering to hand-off other requests to another process. This way, Nginx doesn't have to load in PHP or know about Python or Ruby in order to handle a web request.

How, then, does Nginx hand-off a request to a dynamic application? As mentioned, it passes the request off to another process instead of handling the request itself. With PHP, for example, we would install PHP5-FPM alongside Nginx. Nginx would then hande-off any PHP request to PHP5-FPM to process and respond to. In fact, we can install any type of CGI/FastCGI process, or even another http server, to handle a request. These would then process the request and return the result for Nginx to ultimately return to a client (usually a web browser). This lets us use PHP, Python, Ruby and other languages to handle dynamic web requests.

Nginx is actually a frontman for your application. Rather than handling the request, it dispatches dynamic requests off to a process and returns the result. This lets you (potentially) install Nginx on a server that's separate from your application.

Similar to NodeJS, Nginx is evented and runs asynchronously. This helps Nginx work with very low memory usage when its serving static files, ultimately also helping it serve more requests.

Let's see how this works with a few languages.
