## Getting off of MAMP

At some point, *every* programmer finds themselves needing to know their way around a server.

**Servers for Hackers** is a newsletter for those times.

## Another Topic Here
This newsletter with cover things like user management and permissions, firewalls, LAMP stacks, apache, nginx, load balancers, proxies, nodejs, ruby, python, php, search engines, automating processes, handling log files, git, deployment, sql, nosql, development environments, provisioning, **the list can go on forever!**

This is for hackers, programmers, brogrammers and neckbeards ...well, maybe not the neckbeards...  who want to learn more about the common tasks required to setup, secure and otherwise use or abuse their servers.
